# Automated Testing Kit Lambda Function

A NodeJS function for running [ATK](https://www.drupal.org/project/automated_testing_kit/) on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework.

## Initial Configuration

### Serverless
Install [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started):
```shell
npm i serverless -g
```

Serverless binary can be launched via `serverless` or `sls`.

### AWS

Create a user and its access key in [IAM Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users).

Set up AWS CLI and configure `performantlabs` profile.
This Lambda function is configured to be deployed under the `performantlabs` 
profile, this is useful for people who use multiple AWS accounts on the same
workstation.

[This article](https://dev.to/andreasbergstrom/juggling-multiple-aws-cli-profiles-like-a-pro-2h88)
describes setting up AWS profiles.

### Microsoft Playwright Testing Service

Configure [Microsoft Playwright Testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/playwright-testing/quickstart-run-end-to-end-tests?tabs=playwrightcli&pivots=playwright-test-runner)
workspace. Add an [access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/playwright-testing/how-to-manage-access-tokens).

Update the service endpoint in `.env` file.

In AWS Secrets Manager, create a key-value pair secret, named "atk".
Add a pair with key "PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN" and the token value.

### S3 Bucket

Configure S3 bucket to store tests results.

Note that bucket names should be unique among the region.
For instance, a bucket with the name including random token
can be generated by this command

```shell
aws --profile performantlabs s3api create-bucket     --bucket atk-playwright-results-$(uuidgen | tr -d - | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' )     --region us-east-1
```

Update bucket name in `.env` file.

## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
sls deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "atk-lambda-func" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack atk-lambda-func-dev (52s)

functions:
  hello: atk-lambda-func-dev-hello (25 MB)
  execute_tests: atk-lambda-func-dev-execute_tests (25 MB)
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```
sls invoke --function execute_tests --data '{"url":"https://simplytest.me/"}'
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\"message\":\"Tests executed with exit code 1\",\"resultUri\":\"https://atk-playwright-results-05d038085c8a4b8cbddc6064f9892520.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/results/1733771130624/index.json\"}"
}
```

### Local development

The easiest way to develop and test your function is to use the Serverless Framework's `dev` command:

```
sls dev
```

This will start a local emulator of AWS Lambda and tunnel your requests to and from AWS Lambda, allowing you to interact with your function as if it were running in the cloud.

Now you can invoke the function as before, but this time the function will be executed locally. Now you can develop your function locally, invoke it, and see the results immediately without having to re-deploy.

When you are done developing, don't forget to run `serverless deploy` to deploy the function to the cloud.
